<h4>I did a bunch of fun stuff</h4>
<article>
 <ul>
  <li><h4>I hiked Maderas, a 1,394 meter volcano <h4></li>

  <p><h5>
    Despite being the smaller volcano on the island of Ometepe the Maderas still is a huge volcano, almost 1,400 meters high. Coffee plantations are located at the bottom part of the volcano. More uphill grows a cloud forest – a quality in the Pacific only shared by the Mombacho volcano. A high humidity and a dense forest are the result of this climate. Furthermore, there is a lagoon in the inactive crater of the volcano.</h5></p>

<p><h5>Ascending the volcano is only possible by foot. The trail starts off quite steep but in good condition. You will pass some petroglyphs and a nice lookout from where you can see the Concepción volcano and the lake. Hiking will get tougher from this point. The humidity transforms the trail into a muddy, slippery path. The more you ascend, the worse it gets. Sometimes you have to really climb instead of walk.</h5></p>

<p><h5>here are trees everywhere, so don’t expect great views. It is also often clouded which diminishes your view even more. A couple viewpoints are present, however, and from here you will have a splendid view of the Concepción volcano and Lake Nicaragua.</h5></p>

<p><h5>Hiking to the top will take about three and a half hours. From there, you can continue and descent to the lagoon. This will require some tough climbing. The lagoon itself is cold and often covered in mist. To stand at the edge of the lagoon that is surrounded by trees and covered by a mysterious curtain of mist when monkeys howl on the background is quite a special experience, though.</h5></p>

  <li><h4>I went surfing in San Juan Del Sur </h4></li>

  <p><h5>Nicaragua has become a better known surf destination in the last few years, yet still has much smaller crowds compared to Costa Rica. With an average of 300+ days per year of offshore winds attributed to the proximity of Lake Nicaragua, the surfing in Nicaragua remains optimal all day long, with the tides being your main deciding factor of when to paddle out. The best time for surfing in Nicaragua is May thru early December, which is when the most south swells hit Nicaragua’s Pacific coast.</5></p>

<p><h5>San Juan del Sur’s beaches are a great place for all levels of surfers. The most popular and easily accessible surfing beach close to town is Playa Maderas, where both beginners and experts can find great waves.</5></p>

<p><h5>A number of other surf breaks around San Juan del Sur and up and down the coast can only be accessed by boat. You can easily charter a boat for a full or half day in San Juan del Sur. If you are not traveling with your own board you can rent one at one of the surf shops in San Juan del Sur.</h5></p>

  <li><h4>I went volcano boarding down Cerro Negro</h4></li>
  <iframe width="300" height="215" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKOTeWVIhwU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe>
  <p><h5>There's nothing quite like the sudden silence one experiences midway through the descent down a roughly 1,600-foot volcanic slope, having just somersaulted out of the pebble-scraping, air-rushing trajectory previously occupied by you and your volcano board.</5></p>
  <p><h5>Squinting in the Nicaraguan sun, I found the goggles that had flown off my head during my tumble and shimmied over to my board, slowly slipping downhill all the while. I somehow regained my seated position on the board and immediately submitted again to gravity, zooming down, down, down, until I slid to a gentle stop amid applause from fellow boarders.</h5></p>
